RobiNet
=======

Early stage of development. Shhhh, go away!

RobiNet is a _toy_ network simulator. I dream of a mix of Scappy (for the simple
packet manipulation) with Spirent's Avanlanche (for the powerful packet generator).

Written in OCaml so that, if it's not as feature-full as Scappy it won't at least
be as slow :-) Performance wise, the goal is some hundreds of hosts.
